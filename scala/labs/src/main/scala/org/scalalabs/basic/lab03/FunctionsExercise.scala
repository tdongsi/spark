 * This exercise introduces you to Scala functions.

 * Functions let you separate responsibilities, which allow you to maximally reuse code.
 *
 * Create a method measure that accepts any code blocks, executes it and prints the execution time.
 * E.g. 'The execution took <elapsed> ms'.
 * Use the logPerf method provided.
 * Provide a suitable implementation in order to make the corresponding unittest work.
